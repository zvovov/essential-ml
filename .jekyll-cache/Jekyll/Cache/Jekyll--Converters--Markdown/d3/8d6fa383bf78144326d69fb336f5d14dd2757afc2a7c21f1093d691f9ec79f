I"h<p><a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> forms the backbone of many machine learning libraries in python - scikit-learn, SciPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, JAX and many more due to the its speed of execution, in-built data structures and functions to support linear algebra operations. I started with the goal to understand how to write code using NumPy.</p>
